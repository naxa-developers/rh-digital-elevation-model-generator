# Introduction

The extraction of three-dimensional information from two-dimensional imagery has been a longstanding challenge in geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly monocular depth estimation, have opened new possibilities for generating depth maps from single images, offering potential advantages over traditional photogrammetric methods.

Historically, the generation of elevation data from aerial imagery relied primarily on stereoscopic photogrammetry, requiring multiple overlapping images captured from different angles . While effective, this approach necessitates careful flight planning and optimal lighting conditions. LiDAR systems later emerged as a direct measurement solution but remained costly and logistically complex for large-scale deployment 


# Processing Large-Scale Geographic Data
The implementation of sliding window techniques with overlap, as demonstrated in the code, addresses several challenges identified in the literature:

1. Memory Constraints: Processing high-resolution geographic data often exceeds available GPU memory, necessitating patch-based approaches 
2. Boundary Artifacts: The use of weighted overlapping windows, implemented through Hanning windows in the code, mitigates edge effects documented in similar applications 
3. Spatial Continuity: The overlapping strategy ensures seamless depth maps, crucial for geological and hydrological applications
